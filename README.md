The repository consists of 3 files.
* replace.py helps to delete lines with this information
* table create.py used for creating a test table in PostgreSQL
* SQL checker.py Tries to execute the SQL code from the folder. If it gets errors it moves to the error folder, or if it is no errors, the SQL file moves to the ready folder.
